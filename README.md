django-mongotesting
===================

An extension to the Django web framework that provides testing support for mongoengine dependent modules.

See http://nubits.org/post/testing-with-django-and-mongoengine/


Requirements
============

* Django 1.2+
* MongoEngine

Usage
=====

First, define MONGO_DATABASES and MONGO_PORT settings. Including the mongo connection bit, you should have something like this in your settings.py file:

    MONGO_DATABASES = {
        # db_name, db_alias
        'dbname': 'alias', 
    }
    MONGO_HOST = 'localhost'
    MONGO_PORT = 27017
    import mongoengine
    for db_name, db_alias in MONGO_DATABASES.keys():
        mongoengine.connect(db_name, host=MONGO_HOST, port=MONGO_PORT)

If you would like a test mongo db created and destroyed for each test method in a class then inherit the MongoTestCase class from the mongotesting module.

If you would like a test mongo db created and destroyed for each test class, then define the TEST_RUNNER setting to use MongoTestRunner, as follows:

    TEST_RUNNER = 'mongotesting.MongoTestRunner'
